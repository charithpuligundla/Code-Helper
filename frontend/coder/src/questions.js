Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present./nRead in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored./nConvert these digits into an integer (i.e. \"123\" -> 123, \"0032\" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2)./nIf the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1./nReturn the integer as the final result.",
